    <p>
        JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
        The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written
        right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
        Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
        Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that
        has a special program called the JavaScript engine.
        The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.
        <br>
        There are at least three great things about JavaScript:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Full integration with HTML/CSS.</li>
        <li>Simple things are done simply.</li>
        <li>Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these three things.
        That’s what makes JavaScript unique. That’s why it’s the most widespread tool for creating browser interfaces.
        That said, JavaScript can be used to create servers, mobile applications, etc.

    <h2>Data types:</h2>
    <p>
        There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.
        <br>
        Seven primitive data types:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1)</li>
        <li>bigint for integer numbers of arbitrary length</li>
        <li>string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type
        </li>
        <li>boolean for true/false</li>
        <li>null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null</li>
        <li>undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined</li>
        <li>symbol for unique identifiers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And one non-primitive data type:
        object for more complex data structures.
    </p>
    <h2>Loops and array methods</h2>
    <p>
        There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an
        action some number of times.
    </p>
    <h4>Array.prototype.map()</h4>
    <p>
        It creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling
        array.
        <br>
        The following code takes an array of numbers and creates a new array containing the square roots of the numbers
        in the first array.
    </p>
    <pre class="language-javascript cs-overwrite">
        <code>
            const numbers = [1, 4, 9];
            const roots = numbers.map((num) => Math.sqrt(num));

            // roots is now     [1, 2, 3]
            // numbers is still [1, 4, 9]
        </code>
    </pre>
    <h4>Array.prototype.filter()</h4>
    <p>
        This method creates a shallow copy (a copy whose properties share the same references as those of the
        source object from which the copy was made) of a portion of a given array, filtered down to just the elements from the
        given array that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
        <br>
        The following code creates a filtered array that has all elements with values less than 10 removed.
    </p>
    <pre class="language-javascript cs-overwrite">
        <code>
            function isBigEnough(value) {
                return value >= 10;
            }

            const filtered = [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].filter(isBigEnough);

            // filtered is [12, 130, 44]
        </code>
    </pre>
    <h4>Array.prototype.forEach()</h4>
    <p>
        The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element.
    </p>
    <pre class="language-javascript cs-overwrite">
        <code>
            const numbers = [1, 4, 9];
            numbers.forEach((number) => console.log(number))
        </code>
    </pre>
    <h4>Array.prototype.reduce()</h4>
    <p>
        The reduce() method executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback function on each element of the array, in order,
        passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer
        across all elements of the array is a single value.
        <br>
        The following code returns the sum of the elements in the numbers array.
    </p>
    <pre class="language-javascript cs-overwrite">
        <code>
            const numbers = [1, 4, 9];
            numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);

            // returns 1 + 4 + 9 = 14
        </code>
    </pre>
    <h4>Array.prototype.sort()</h4>
    <p>
        The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the reference to the same array,
        now sorted. The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings,
        then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values. It can optionally take a compare function as a parameter as well.
    </p>
    <h4>Array.prototype.find()</h4>
    <p>
        The find() method returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function.
        <br>
        If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.
    </p>
