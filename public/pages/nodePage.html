        Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        It runs on the V8 JavaScript Engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers
        use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on
        the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
        Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a
        single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once Node.js is installed on our computer, we can easily run a JavaScript file with the following command:
    </p>
    <pre  class="language-javascript cs-overwrite cs-one-line">
        <code>
            node app.js
        </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="img-center">
        <img style="width: 5vw"
             src="/assets/images/nodemon_logo.png">
    </div>
    <h3>nodemon</h3>
    <p>
        If we want to streamline our development process further, we can install nodemon. Nodemon is a tool that helps develop
        Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
        Nodemon does not require any additional changes to our code or method of development. It is a replacement wrapper for node.
        To use nodemon, we replace the word node on the command line when executing our script.

            npm install nodemon
